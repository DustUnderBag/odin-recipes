This project is to create a recipe website using only HTML. The aim is to start building actual stuff with knowledge I have learnt in the past weeks.
By the time I complete this project, I will be demonstrating my skills of HTML basics, version control using Git & GitHub, and some terminal skills like navigating 
through directories, interactiing with files,  committing code, and etc.
