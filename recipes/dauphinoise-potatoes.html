        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These Dauphinoise potatoes are luscious and creamy. The potatoes will be 
            <br>     
            perfectly seasoned after absorbing all the flavor in the sauce, and come out super tender.

        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed <br>and sliced 1/8-inch thick with peel</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, plus <br>more for garnish</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 large tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>

            <li>4 ounces Gruyere cheese, shredded</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.<br><br> </li>

            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                <br>Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. 
                <br>Drain and set aside until needed.<br><br> </li>

            <li>Layer 1/2 of the potatoes in the prepared baking dish; sprinkle 1/2 cup cheese 
                <br>evenly over potatoes. Top with remaining potatoes and spoon remaining liquid
                <br>left in the pot over the potatoes. Top with remaining 1/2 cup cheese.<br><br> </li>
                
            <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet over medium heat. 
                <br>Whisk in flour until fully combined and starting to turn golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. 
                <br>Whisk in chicken broth until combined, then repeat with milk. 
                <br>Stir in tomatoes, lemon juice, salt, and pepper; bring to a simmer.<br><br> </li>
            
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until sauce is thickened, top is browned in spots, and 
                <br>potatoes are tender, 40 to 45 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving;
                <br>garnish with additional thyme.<br><br> </li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden on top and bubbling around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes.<br><br> </li>

        </ol>
