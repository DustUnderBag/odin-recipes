        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a one pan meal that's in the oven in 15 minutes. Rosemary, garlic, and 
            <br>oregano create a mouth watering aroma. If using dried herbs in place of fresh,
            <br>use 1/3 the amount. Potatoes are crispy like french fries, just serve with ketchup.
            <br>Kids just love this!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>Place chicken and potatoes into a large bowl. Pour olive oil over them, and stir 
                <br>to coat. Scatter the chicken and potato pieces in a large baking dish, or cookie
